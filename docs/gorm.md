# Requirements for Applying GORM to the Repository

## 1. Integrate GORM into the Project
- Add GORM as a dependency in the project.
- Configure the database connection using GORM's `gorm.Open` method.
- Ensure proper error handling during database initialization.

## 2. Refactor Database Access to Use Repository Pattern
- Create repository interfaces for each entity to abstract database operations.
- Implement repository structs that use GORM for database interactions.
- Replace raw SQL queries with GORM methods (e.g., `Create`, `Find`, `Where`, `Update`, `Delete`).

## 3. Define Models
- Define GORM models for each database table.
- Use GORM tags to map struct fields to table columns (e.g., `gorm:"column:name"`).
- Add relationships (e.g., `hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo`) where applicable.

## 4. Migrate Database Schema
- Use GORM's `AutoMigrate` method to manage schema migrations.
- Ensure migrations are idempotent and safe for production environments.

## 5. Testing and Validation
- Write unit tests for repository methods using mock databases.
- Validate GORM queries to ensure they produce the expected results.

## 6. Documentation and Best Practices
- Document the repository pattern and GORM usage in the project.
- Follow GORM best practices for performance and maintainability.
